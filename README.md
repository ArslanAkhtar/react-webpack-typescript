# React + TypeScript + Webpack + ESLint + Prettier Example App

This repository contains an example application built using React, TypeScript, Webpack, ESLint, and Prettier. It serves as a starting point for developing React applications with a consistent code style and development environment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/ArslanAkhtar/react-webpack-typescript.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-typescript-webpack-eslint-prettier-example`.
3. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Start the development server: `npm start`.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a specific folder structure to keep the code organized and maintainable:

- `src/`: Contains the application source code.
  - `components/`: Contains React components used in the application.
  - `styles/`: Contains CSS or SCSS files for styling.
  - `App.tsx`: The main component that serves as the entry point of the application.
  - `index.tsx`: The entry file that renders the application into the DOM.
- `public/`: Contains static assets that will be served by the development server.
- `dist/`: The output folder where the bundled application is generated by Webpack.
- `webpack.config.js`: Configuration file for Webpack.
- `.eslintrc.json`: ESLint configuration file.
- `.prettierrc`: Prettier configuration file.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available to manage the project:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server and opens the application in your browser.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production and generates the bundled output in the `dist/` folder.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint and displays any linting errors or warnings.
- `npm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier and applies code styling conventions.

## Code Quality and Formatting

This project utilizes ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistent code style. ESLint helps catch potential issues and enforce coding standards, while Prettier ensures consistent formatting across the codebase.

You can run `npm run lint` to check for any linting errors or warnings in the code. Use `npm run format` to automatically format your code according to the project's style rules.
